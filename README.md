# Github actions - I use 2 laptops at this point, a Macbook air with M2 chip, and a very good windows laptop. The reason I saw this is because I've had to figure out how most things work twice- as if they need any download, it's likely a different process on both of these machines. Having a central repository for me to update pieces of code as my day's went along was important- regardless of which computer I was on. VS-code allowed the most versatility in updating a Github Repository directly, and after figuring out how to update the Git Bash for my login details, the rest was simpler. This takes us along to the next part I thought was important, which was creating an infrastructure-as-code system.
# Terraform - Installing to windows is required however, not accessible via GUI, but your windows powershell, where you need to create a new directory that you will have access to through VS code. PS. Using the terminal to access accounts and not hard code passwords is best practice. I had initially set up my resources in the GUI/ console, however I wanted an easily replicable code base available to be able to set up the same environmeent with the click of a button - or Terraform plan
